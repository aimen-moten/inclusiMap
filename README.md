# Inspiration
We observed the lack of accessibility for individuals with disabilities in various places worldwide, prompting us to create an accessibility map featuring marked locations where everyone can explore the area on equal footing. Before settling on New York City, we extensively researched potential locations, including places like Bangladesh. Ultimately, we chose NYC due to its abundance of online resources, such as information on accessible train stations and parking lots, making it an ideal choice for a city of its magnitude.

# What it does
Introducing our revolutionary InclusiMap, unlocking a world of inclusive exploration where individuals with disabilities can fully embrace the wonders of each destination. With meticulous marks guiding the way, we are breaking down barriers and redefining accessibility, ensuring that everyone can experience the joy of discovering our extraordinary world.

# How we built it
GitHub was used to push, pull, and fork all the code in the repositories using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We used Google Cloud to get the API key from Google Map's Javascript API. We used React for front-end and firestore of firebase for backend.

# Challenges we ran into
We had to do a lot of debugging to integrate the google maps API and firebase firestore backend to our react frontend. A lot of time database didn't work properly and we were unable to get data from the API. We found very silly mistakes into our code preventing us from getting desired result.

Engaging in front-end work with various CSS elements posed more difficulties than initially anticipated, given the limited design experience. However, the task was ultimately accomplished. Designing a thank-you page or implementing a function to display a gratitude note also proved to be challenging, as unexpected bugs surfaced in the code. Nonetheless, these issues were successfully resolved.

We obtained inclusimap.tech domain, but had trouble connecting it to the GitHub Pages.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Working with google maps API
2. having a good design
3. Collaboration with a diversified team (All of us are from different countries and from completely different timezone

# What we learned
We learned that communication and teamwork are one of the big factors that led to the success and completion of the project. We also learned about collaboration in git and github, APIs, Database.

# What's next for InclusiMap
Our initial plan was to add more maps (NYC, Karachi and Bangladesh), add authentication, add a chatbot. Next we can also add some community reviewing feature and make this app for all platforms.
